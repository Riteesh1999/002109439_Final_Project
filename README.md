Project Description: Quickr Booking Agency is the name of the imaginary company that I used to make this project. In this project there are three services that the agency offers. The services are booking flight tickets, hotel rooms and also outdoor activities. 

	The flight, hotel and activity managers have access only to their respective departments. They can create and delete new flights, activities, and hotels with their location. They can also cancel confirmed reservations as well. The admin, however, has access to all the services that are being provided. A third-party company to book tickets using our platform has also been created and they have restricted access to all services. 

	Users can directly sign-up and create password and username, to login and book tickets. All the data that is being entered in the UI will automatically be uploaded to a MySQL database and can be retrieved whenever necessary.

	A login page with a separate login button for admins and users has been created. This admin login button has 5 different admin login information and takes them to different Frames based on their login details. The user login button retrieves data from the passenger table and takes them to a separate page from where they can book flights, hotels, and outdoor activities.
